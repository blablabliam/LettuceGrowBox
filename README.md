<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In 2019, NASA and Instructables got together to make a challenge: design and build a grow box for the International Space Station. Having just gained access to a 3D printer at the local MakerSpace, I decided to try my hand at the project using as many 3D printed components as possible. It didn't take long before the project had programmable custom light rings on 3D printed circuit boards, 3D printed fans, and 3D printed housings. In the end, the only parts I couldn't 3D print were the electronic components themselves.

Of course, a 3D printer isn't the solution to every problem, and in this case the project didn't win the challenge for obvious reasons. I still like to think that the modular design and rail system were pretty neat :satisfied:


### Built With

* [Onshape](www.onshape.com)
* [Arduino](www.arduino.cc)


<!-- DESIGN DESCRIPTION -->
## Design

The grow chambers are 3D printed cubes, just tall enough for a microgreen like [Outredgeous Lettuce](https://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/lettuce/romaine-lettuce-cos/outredgeous-lettuce-seed-2208N.html), to grow to harvest height. Each 3D printed cube has a fully customizable environment for easy experimentation on light, nutrients, airflow, and more. The cubes have rails for running wires and clipping attachments, and each box has slots to clip a 3D printable circuit board for lighting. 

Full build instructions can be found on Instructables, where the project was submitted for a challenge!
